# Firebase Authentication Deletion Issue

## Problem
Users deleted from the admin panel remain in Firebase Authentication and can potentially still login.

## Current Workaround
The system creates a `disabled_users` collection entry and deletes the user profile. However, Firebase Auth account remains.

## Required Integration
Add this code to your login/authentication system:

```javascript
import { isUserDisabled, doesUserProfileExist } from './pages/UserManagement/UserManagement.js';

// In your login success handler (after Firebase Auth succeeds):
export const handleLoginSuccess = async (userCredential) => {
  const userId = userCredential.user.uid;
  
  try {
    // Check if user was deleted by admin
    if (await isUserDisabled(userId)) {
      // Sign out immediately
      await auth.signOut();
      throw new Error('This account has been disabled by an administrator');
    }
    
    // Check if user profile exists
    if (!(await doesUserProfileExist(userId))) {
      // Sign out immediately
      await auth.signOut();
      throw new Error('User profile not found - account may have been deleted');
    }
    
    // Proceed with normal login flow
    console.log('Login successful');
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Login blocked:', error.message);
    // Show error to user and redirect to login
    alert(error.message);
    window.location.href = '/login';
  }
};
```

## Proper Solution (Recommended)
Implement Firebase Cloud Function with Admin SDK for complete user deletion:

1. Create Firebase Cloud Function
2. Use Firebase Admin SDK to delete from Authentication
3. Delete from Firestore database
4. Update admin panel to call the Cloud Function

This will completely remove users from both Authentication and Database.
